Even though scRNA-seq makes it possible to address problems that are intractable with bulk RNA-seq data, analysing scRNA-seq is also more challenging. In this course we will be surveying the existing problems as well as the available computational and statistical frameworks available for the analysis of scRNA-seq.  1.1 Registration http://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/event/1626698   1.2 GitHub https://github.com/hemberg-lab/scRNA.seq.course   1.3 License Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License   1.4 Prerequisites The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with Unix and the R scripting language.

For a discussion on experimental methods, please see reviews by Saliba et al, Handley et al or Kolodziejczyk et al.   3.4 Analysis This course is concerned with the computational analysis of the data obtained from scRNA-seq experiments. Even though the format of the data is the same as for bulk RNA-seq, the fact that individual cells are sampled means that the data should be analyzed differently. We will provide an overview of how to process a scRNA-seq sample and how to analyze the data to provide biological insights.     Flowchart for analyzing scRNA-seq data.   3.5 Challenges The main difference between bulk and single cell RNA-seq is that each sequencing library represents a single cell, instead of a population of cells. Therefore, significant attention has to be paid to comparison of the results from different cells (sequencing libraries). The main sources of discrepancy between the libraries are:  Amplification (up to 1 million fold) Gene ‘dropouts’ in which a gene is observed at a moderate expression level in one cell but is not detected in another cell (Kharchenko et al).  In both cases the discrepancies are introduced due to low starting transcript amount (from one cell only) and have yet to be addressed by improving the experimental protocol.   3.6 Controls To address challenges in technical variation between scRNA sequencing libraries two quantitative standards were introduced. They allow to normalize gene expression levels across different cells.  3.6.1 ERCC spike-ins One standard, strongly recommended for all scRNA-seq experiments is to use extrinsic spike-in molecules. These molecules are added to the lysate before the reverse transcription. The most popular and widely used artificial spike-ins are from External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC). It contains 92 synthetic spikes based on bacterial sequences. Normalization using spike-ins is based on the fact that the number of molecules of each spike-in RNA species should be the same across all single-cell libraries.   3.6.2 UMIs Another method of standartisation is to use Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). Instead of sequencing the amplified reads from a cell library, it allows for sequencing reads derived solely from 3’ or 5’ end of the amplified transcript. UMIs are added as barcodes to the individual RNA molecules. This approach provides an estimate of the number of transcripts that is independent of amplification biases.    "],
["construction-of-expression-matrix.html", "4 Construction of expression matrix 4.1 Reads QC 4.2 Reads alignment 4.3 Alignment example 4.4 Mapping QC 4.5 Reads quantification", " 4 Construction of expression matrix  4.1 Reads QC The output from a scRNA-seq experiment is a large collection of short cDNA reads. The first step is to ensure that the reads are of high quality. In application to scRNA-seq, this can be performed by using standard bulk RNA-seq QC tools, such as FastQC or Kraken. Currently, there are no specialized tools for scRNA-seq available, so we use FastQC. Assuming that our reads are in experiment.bam, we run FastQC as $&lt;path_to_fastQC&gt;/fastQC experiment.bam Below is an example of the output from FastQC for a dataset of 125 bp reads. Here, the quality of the reads is overall high, so we can proceed the analysis with confidence.     Additionally, the data can be visualized using the Integrative Genomics Browser (IGV).   4.2 Reads alignment Once the low-quality reads have been removed, the remaining reads can be mapped to a reference genome. Again, there are no special purpose methods for this, so we can use the STAR or the TopHat aligner. An example of how to map reads.bam to using STAR hg38 is $&lt;path_to_STAR&gt;/STAR --runThreadN 1 --runMode alignReads --readFilesIn reads1.fq.gz reads2.fq.gz --readFilesCommand zcat --genomeDir &lt;path&gt; --parametersFiles FileOfMoreParameters.txt --outFileNamePrefix &lt;outpath&gt;/output Note, if the spike-ins are used, the reference sequence should be augmented with the DNA sequence of the spike-in molecules before mapping. Note, when UMIs are used, their barcodes should be removed from every read. Once we have mapped the reads for each cell to the reference genome, we need to make sure that a sufficient number of reads from each cell could be mapped to the reference genome. In our experience, the fraction of mappable reads is 60-70%. However, this result may vary depending on protocol, read length and settings for the read alignment. As a general rule, we expect all cells to have a similar fraction of mapped reads, so any outliers should be inspected and possibly removed.   4.3 Alignment example The histogram below shows the total number of reads mapped to each cell for an scRNA-seq experiment. Each bar represents one cell, and they have been sorted in ascending order by the total number of reads per cell. The three red arrows indicate cells that are outliers in terms of their coverage and they should be removed from further analysis. The two yellow arrows point to cells with a surprisingly large number of unmapped reads. However, we deem the discrepancy as small and we retain the cells for now.       4.4 Mapping QC After mapping the raw sequencing to the genome we should evaluate the quality of the mapping. There are many ways to measure this including: amount of reads mapping to rRNA/tRNAs, proportion of uniquely mapping reads, reads mapping across splice junctions, read depth along the transcripts. Methods developed for bulk RNA-seq, such as RSeQC, are applicable to single-cell data: python &lt;RSeQCpath&gt;/geneBody_coverage.py -i input.bam -r genome.bed -o output.txt python &lt;RSeQCpath&gt;/bam_stat.py -i input.bam -r genome.bed -o output.txt python &lt;RSeQCpath&gt;/split_bam.py -i input.bam -r rRNAmask.bed -o output.txt However the expected results will depend on the experimental protocol, e.g. many scRNA-seq methods use poly-A selection to avoid sequencing rRNAs which results in a 3’ bias in the read coverage across the genes (aka gene body coverage). The figure below shows this 3’ bias as well as three cells which were outliers and removed from the dataset:       4.5 Reads quantification The next step is to quantify the expression level of each gene for each cell. For mRNA data, we can use one of the tools which has been developed for bulk RNA-seq data, e.g. HT-seq or FeatureCounts # include multimapping &lt;featureCounts_path&gt;/featureCounts -O -M -Q 30 -p -a genome.gtf -o outputfile input.bam # exclude multimapping &lt;featureCounts_path&gt;/featureCounts -Q 30 -p -a genome.gtf -o outputfile input.bam Note, when UMIs are used, the expression counts can be collapsed by summing the number of unique barcodes associated with all reads mapped to a given gene.

This package contains useful tools for the analysis of single-cell gene expression data using the statistical software R. The package places an emphasis on tools for quality control, visualisation and pre-processing of data before further downstream analysis. scater enables the following:  Automated computation of QC metrics Transcript quantification from read data with pseudo-alignment Data format standardisation Rich visualisations for exploratory analysis Seamless integration into the Bioconductor universe Simple normalisation methods  We highly recommend to use scater for any single-cell RNA-seq analysis you will be doing in the future. scater is the basis of the first part of the course and therefore we will spend some time explaining its details.   5.2 scater workflow       5.3 Terminology (this chapter is taken from the scater vignette)  The capabilities of scater are built on top of Bioconductor’s Biobase. In Bioconductor terminology we assay numerous “features” for a number of “samples”. Features, in the context of scater, correspond most commonly to genes or transcripts, but could be any general genomic or transcriptomic regions (e.g. exon) of interest for which we take measurements. In the following chapters it may be more intuitive to mentally replace “feature” with “gene” or “transcript” (depending on the context of the study) wherever “feature” appears. In the scater context, “samples” refer to individual cells that we have assayed.    5.4 SCESet class (this chapter is taken from the scater vignette) In scater we organise single-cell expression data in objects of the SCESet class. The class inherits the Bioconductor ExpressionSet class, which provides a common interface familiar to those who have analyzed microarray experiments with Bioconductor. The class requires three input files:  exprs, a numeric matrix of expression values, where rows are features, and columns are cells phenoData, an AnnotatedDataFrame object, where rows are cells, and columns are cell attributes (such as cell type, culture condition, day captured, etc.) featureData, an AnnotatedDataFrame object, where rows are features (e.g. genes), and columns are feature attributes, such as biotype, gc content, etc.  For more details about other features inherited from Bioconductor’s ExpressionSet class, type ?ExpressionSet at the R prompt. When your data is wrapped in the SCESet class, scater will do the dirty job of calculating different properties of the data automatically. You will see how it works in the next chapters.   "],

Failure to remove low quality cells at this stage will add a large amount of technical noise which will obscure the biological signals of interest in downstream analysis. We will demonstrate some simple filters that can be applied directly to the gene expression matrix with minimal extrinsic information. Typically, the results are summarized using an expression matrix. In the expression matrix, each row represents a gene and each column represents a cell. To illustrate cell QC, we consider a dataset from lymphoblast and induced pluripotent stem cells generated by John Blischak in Yoav Gilad’s lab at the University of Chicago. The experiments were carried out on the Fluidigm C1 platform and to facilitate the quantification both unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and ERCC spike-ins were used. For our purposes you need to download the files annotation.txt, molecules.txt, and reads.txt from here into the blischak folder in your working directory. These files are the copies of the original files made on the 15/03/16. We will use these copies for reproducibility purposes. To illustrate how one can standardise the analysis of scRNA-seq data we will also be using the scater package, described in the previous chapter.   6.2 Blischak dataset library(scater, quietly = TRUE) library(knitr) options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) opts_chunk$set(out.width=&#39;90%&#39;, fig.align = &#39;center&#39;) Load the data and annotations: molecules &lt;- read.table(&quot;blischak/molecules.txt&quot;, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;) anno &lt;- read.table(&quot;blischak/annotation.txt&quot;, sep = &quot;\\t&quot;, header = TRUE) How does the data look like? knitr::kable(     head(molecules[ , 1:3]), booktabs = TRUE,     caption = &#39;A table of the first 6 rows and 3 columns of the molecules table.&#39; )  Table 6.1: A table of the first 6 rows and 3 columns of the molecules table.

We define a detectable gene expression level, in which at least 2 cells contain more than 1 read mapping to the gene. filter_genes &lt;- apply(counts(umi), 1, function(x) length(x[x &gt; 1]) &gt;= 2) fData(umi)$use &lt;- filter_genes knitr::kable(     as.data.frame(table(filter_genes)),     booktabs = TRUE,     row.names = FALSE,     caption = &#39;The number of genes removed by gene filter (FALSE)&#39; )  Table 6.3: The number of genes removed by gene filter (FALSE)   filter_genes Freq     FALSE 4512   TRUE 14214    Depending on the cell-type, protocol and sequencing depth, other cut-offs may be appropriate.   6.5 Cell QC  6.5.1 Library size Next we will look at the total number of RNA molecules detected per sample (if we were using read counts rather than UMI counts this would be total reads). Wells with few reads/molecules are likely to have been broken or failed to capture a cell, thus should be removed. hist(     umi$total_counts,     breaks = 100 )    Figure 6.3: Histogram of library sizes for all cells   Exercise Apply a suitable filter to remove the cells that contain too few molecules. What distribution do you expect that the total number of molecules for each cell should follow? Answer filter_by_total_counts &lt;- (umi$total_counts &gt; 10000) knitr::kable(     as.data.frame(table(filter_by_total_counts)),     booktabs = TRUE,     row.names = FALSE,     caption = &#39;The number of cells removed by total counts filter (FALSE)&#39; )  Table 6.4: The number of cells removed by total counts filter (FALSE)   filter_by_total_counts Freq     FALSE 2   TRUE 862      6.5.2 Detected genes (1) One of the simplest measures of cell quality is the number of genes that were detected. Cells with few detected genes may have been broken or dead prior to capture. hist(     umi$total_features,     breaks = 100 )    Figure 6.4: Histogram of the number of detected genes in all cells   Here we see that most cells have between 5,000-11,000 detected genes, which is normal for high-depth scRNA-seq. However this varies by experimental protocol and sequencing depth with droplet-based methods or lower sequencing-depth detecting fewer genes per cell. The feature to note is the “heavy tail” of the left hand side of the distribution. If detection rates were equal across the cells then the distribution should be approximately normal. Thus we remove those cells in the tail of the distribution (&lt;5,000 detected genes). filter_by_expr_features &lt;- (umi$total_features &gt; 5000) knitr::kable(     as.data.frame(table(filter_by_expr_features)),     booktabs = TRUE,     row.names = FALSE,     caption = &#39;The number of cells removed by total features filter (FALSE)&#39; )  Table 6.5: The number of cells removed by total features filter (FALSE)   filter_by_expr_features Freq     FALSE 16   TRUE 848      6.5.3 Detected genes (2) Additionally, we can plot the library size as a function of the number of the detected genes. This will also allow us to find other cell outliers. scater::plotPhenoData(     umi,     aes(x = total_features, y = log10(total_counts), colour = batch) )    Figure 6.5: Library size vs number of detected genes     6.5.4 ERCCs and MTs Another measures of cell quality is the ration between ERCC spike-in RNAs and endogenous RNAs. This can be used to estimate the total amount of RNA in the captured cells. Cells with a high level of spike-in RNAs had low starting amounts of RNA, likely due to the cell being dead or stressed, or the RNA being degraded. scater::plotPhenoData(     umi,     aes_string(x = &quot;total_features&quot;,                y = &quot;pct_counts_feature_controls_MT&quot;,                colour = &quot;batch&quot;) )    Figure 6.6: Percentage of counts in MT genes   scater::plotPhenoData(     umi,     aes_string(x = &quot;total_features&quot;,                y = &quot;pct_counts_feature_controls_ERCC&quot;,                colour = &quot;batch&quot;) )    Figure 6.7: Percentage of counts in ERCCs   This analysis shows that majority of the cells from NA19098.r2 batch have a very high ERCC/Endo ratio. Indeed, it has been shown by the authors that this batch contains cells of smaller size. Exercise Create filters for removing batch NA19098.r2 and cells with high expression of mitochondrial genes (&gt;10% of total counts in a cell).

The advantage of doing this is that the QC metrics focus on technical aspects of the libraries that are likely to distinguish problematics cells. Automatic outlier detection on PCA plots using QC metrics is available to help identify potentially problematic cells. By default, the following metrics are used for PCA-based outlier detection:  pct_counts_top_100_features total_features pct_counts_feature_controls n_detected_feature_controls log10_counts_endogenous_features log10_counts_feature_controls  A particular set of variables to be used can be specified with the selected_variables argument as shown in the example below. umi &lt;- scater::plotPCA(umi,                 size_by = &quot;total_features&quot;,                  shape_by = &quot;filter_on_total_features&quot;,                 pca_data_input = &quot;pdata&quot;,                 detect_outliers = TRUE,                 return_SCESet = TRUE) ## The following cells/samples are detected as outliers: ## NA19098.r2.A01 ## NA19098.r2.A02 ## NA19098.r2.A06 ## NA19098.r2.A09 ## NA19098.r2.A10 ## NA19098.r2.A12 ## NA19098.r2.B01 ## NA19098.r2.B03 ## NA19098.r2.B04 ## NA19098.r2.B05 ## NA19098.r2.B07 ## NA19098.r2.B11 ## NA19098.r2.B12 ## NA19098.r2.C01 ## NA19098.r2.C02 ## NA19098.r2.C03 ## NA19098.r2.C04 ## NA19098.r2.C05 ## NA19098.r2.C06 ## NA19098.r2.C07 ## NA19098.r2.C08 ## NA19098.r2.C09 ## NA19098.r2.C10 ## NA19098.r2.C11 ## NA19098.r2.C12 ## NA19098.r2.D01 ## NA19098.r2.D02 ## NA19098.r2.D03 ## NA19098.r2.D04 ## NA19098.r2.D07 ## NA19098.r2.D08 ## NA19098.r2.D09 ## NA19098.r2.D10 ## NA19098.r2.D12 ## NA19098.r2.E01 ## NA19098.r2.E02 ## NA19098.r2.E03 ## NA19098.r2.E04 ## NA19098.r2.E05 ## NA19098.r2.E06 ## NA19098.r2.E07 ## NA19098.r2.E12 ## NA19098.r2.F01 ## NA19098.r2.F02 ## NA19098.r2.F07 ## NA19098.r2.F08 ## NA19098.r2.F09 ## NA19098.r2.F10 ## NA19098.r2.F11 ## NA19098.r2.F12 ## NA19098.r2.G01 ## NA19098.r2.G02 ## NA19098.r2.G03 ## NA19098.r2.G05 ## NA19098.r2.G06 ## NA19098.r2.G08 ## NA19098.r2.G09 ## NA19098.r2.G10 ## NA19098.r2.G11 ## NA19098.r2.H01 ## NA19098.r2.H02 ## NA19098.r2.H03 ## NA19098.r2.H04 ## NA19098.r2.H05 ## NA19098.r2.H06 ## NA19098.r2.H07 ## NA19098.r2.H08 ## NA19098.r2.H10 ## NA19098.r2.H12 ## NA19101.r3.A02 ## NA19101.r3.C12 ## NA19101.r3.D01 ## NA19101.r3.E08 ## Variables with highest loadings for PC1 and PC2: ##  ##                                            PC1         PC2 ## ---------------------------------  -----------  ---------- ## pct_counts_top_100_features          0.4771343   0.3009332 ## pct_counts_feature_controls          0.4735839   0.3309562 ## n_detected_feature_controls          0.1332811   0.5367629 ## log10_counts_feature_controls       -0.1427373   0.5911762 ## total_features                      -0.5016681   0.2936705 ## log10_counts_endogenous_features    -0.5081855   0.2757918    Figure 6.8: PCA plot used for automatic detection of cell outliers   knitr::kable(   as.data.frame(table(umi$outlier)),   booktabs = TRUE,   row.names = FALSE,   caption = &#39;The number of cells removed by automatic filter (FALSE)&#39; )  Table 6.9: The number of cells removed by automatic filter (FALSE)   Var1 Freq     FALSE 791   TRUE 73      6.6.3 Manual However, since we performed a more detailed analysis, visualized different features and defined our own filters we can use them instead of the default ones: umi$use &lt;- (     # sufficient features (genes)     filter_by_expr_features &amp;     # sufficient molecules counted     filter_by_total_counts &amp;     # sufficient endogenous RNA     filter_by_ERCC &amp;     # remove cells with unusual number of reads in MT genes     filter_by_MT ) knitr::kable(   as.data.frame(table(umi$use)),   booktabs = TRUE,   row.names = FALSE,   caption = &#39;The number of cells removed by manual filter (FALSE)&#39; )  Table 6.10: The number of cells removed by manual filter (FALSE)   Var1 Freq     FALSE 141   TRUE 723       6.7 Compare filterings Exercise Compare the default, automatic and manual cell filters.

Exploring the effects of such variabilities (both those recorded during the experiment and computed QC metrics) is crucial for appropriate modeling of the data. The scater package provides a set of methods specifically for quality control of experimental and explanatory variables. Here we will continue to work with the Blischak data that was used in the previous chapter. The umi.qc dataset contains filtered cells and genes. Our next step is to explore technical drivers of variability in the data to inform data normalisation before downstream analysis.   10.2 Correlations with PCs Let’s first look again at the PCA plot of the QCed dataset:    Figure 10.1: PCA plot of the blischak data   scater allows one to identify principle components that correlate with experimental and QC variables of interest (it ranks principle components by \\(R^2\\) from a linear model regressing PC value against the variable of interest). Let’s test whether some of the variables correlate with any of the PCs.  10.2.1 Detected genes    Figure 10.2: PC correlation with the number of detected genes   Indeed, we can see that PC1 can be completely explained by the number of the detected genes. In fact, it was also visible on the PCA plot above. This is a well-known issue in scRNA-seq and was described here.   10.2.2 Control ERCCs    Figure 10.3: PC correlation with the percentage of reads in ERCCs     10.2.3 Control MTs    Figure 10.4: PC correlation with the percentage of reads in MT genes      10.3 Explanatory variables scater can also compute the marginal \\(R^2\\) for each variable when fitting a linear model regressing expression values for each gene against just that variable, and display a density plot of the gene-wise marginal \\(R^2\\) values for the variables.    Figure 10.5: Explanatory variables   This analysis indicates that the number of detected genes (again) and also the sequencing depth (number of counts) have substantial explanatory power for many genes, so these variables are good candidates for conditioning out in a normalisation step, or including in downstream statistical models. Expression of ERCCs also appears to be an important explanatory variable.   10.4 Other confounders In addition to correcting for batch, there are other factors that one may want to compensate for. As with batch correction, these adjustments require extrinsic information. One popular method is scLVM which allows you to identify and subtract the effect from processes such as cell-cycle or apoptosis.   10.5 Exercise Perform the same analysis with read counts of the Blischak data.

This can be done by providing a design matrix to normaliseExprs(). We are not covering this topic here, but you can try to do it yourself as an exercise. Instead we will explore how simple size-factor normalisations correcting for library size can remove the effects of some of the confounders and explanatory variables.   12.2 Library size Library sizes vary because of the various reasons: * scRNA-seq data is often sequenced on highly multiplexed platforms the total reads which are derived from each cell may differ substantially. * Protocols may differ in terms of their coverage of each transcript, their bias based on the average content of A/T nucleotides, or their ability to capture short transcripts. Ideally, we would like to compensate for all of these differences and biases when comparing data from two different experiments. Many methods to correct for library size have been developped for bulk RNA-seq and can be equally applied to scRNA-seq (eg. UQ, SF, CPM, RPKM, FPKM, TPM). Some quantification methods (eg. Cufflinks, RSEM) incorporated library size when determining gene expression estimates thus do not require this normalization. We will continue to work with the Blischak data that was used in the previous chapter and show how scater makes it easy to perform different types of size-factor normalizations. library(scater, quietly = TRUE) library(knitr) options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) opts_chunk$set(out.width=&#39;90%&#39;, fig.align = &#39;center&#39;) umi &lt;- readRDS(&quot;blischak/umi.rds&quot;) umi.qc &lt;- umi[fData(umi)$use, pData(umi)$use] endog_genes &lt;- !fData(umi.qc)$is_feature_control   12.3 Normalisations The simplest way to normalize this data is to convert it to counts per million (CPM) by dividing each column by its total then multiplying by 1,000,000. Note that spike-ins should be excluded from the calculation of total expression in order to correct for total cell RNA content, therefore we will only use endogenous genes. scater performs this normalisation by default, you can control it by changing exprs_values parameter to &quot;exprs&quot;. Another method is called TMM is the weighted trimmed mean of M-values (to the reference) proposed by Robinson and Oshlack (2010), where the weights are from the delta method on Binomial data. Another very popular method RLE is the scaling factor method proposed by Anders and Huber (2010). We call it “relative log expression”, as median library is calculated from the geometric mean of all columns and the median ratio of each sample to the median library is taken as the scale factor. A similar to RLE the upperquartile is the upper-quartile normalization method of Bullard et al (2010), in which the scale factors are calculated from the 75% quantile of the counts for each library, after removing genes which are zero in all libraries. This idea is generalized here to allow scaling by any quantile of the distributions. Let’s compare all these methods.  12.3.1 Raw    Figure 12.1: PCA plot of the blischak data     12.3.2 CPM    Figure 12.2: PCA plot of the blischak data after CPM normalisation     12.3.3 log2(CPM)    Figure 12.3: PCA plot of the blischak data after log2(CPM) normalisation     12.3.4 TMM    Figure 12.4: PCA plot of the blischak data after TMM normalisation     12.3.5 RLE    Figure 12.5: PCA plot of the blischak data after RLE normalisation     12.3.6 Upperquantile    Figure 12.6: PCA plot of the blischak data after UQ normalisation      12.4 Interpretation Clearly, only the CPM normalisation has reduced the effect of the number of detected genes and separated cells by individuals (though very weakly).   12.5 Other methods Some methods combine library size and fragment/gene length normalization such as:  RPKM - Reads Per Kilobase Million (for single-end sequencing) FPKM - Fragments Per Kilobase Million (same as RPKM but for paired-end sequencing, makes sure that paired ends mapped to the same fragment are not counted twice) TPM - Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (same as RPKM, but the order of normalizations is reversed - length first and sequencing depth second)  These methods are not applicable to our dataset since the end of the transcript which contains the UMI was preferentially sequenced. Furthermore in general these should only be calculated using appropriate quantification software from aligned BAM files not from read counts since often only a portion of the entire gene/transcript is sequenced, not the entire length. However, here we show how these normalisations can be calculated using scater. First, we need to find the effective transcript length in Kilobases. However, our dataset containes only gene IDs, therefore we will be using the gene lengths instead of transcripts. scater uses the biomaRt package, which allows one to annotate genes by other attributes: Some of the genes were not annotated, therefore we filter them out: Now we compute the effective gene length in Kilobases by using the end_position and start_position fields: Now we are ready to perform the normalisations: Plot the results as a PCA plot:    Figure 12.7: PCA plot of the blischak data after FPKM normalisation   TPM normalisation produce a zero-matrix, we are not sure why, it maybe a bug in scater.   12.6 Visualize genes Now after the normalisation we are ready to visualise the gene expression:  12.6.1 Raw    Figure 12.8: Expression of the first 6 genes of the blischak data     12.6.2 CPM    Figure 12.9: Expression of the first 6 genes of the blischak data after the CPM normalisation     12.6.3 log2(CPM)    Figure 12.10: Expression of the first 6 genes of the blischak data after the log2(CPM) normalisation     12.6.4 Upperquantile    Figure 12.11: Expression of the first 6 genes of the blischak data after the UQ normalisation     12.6.5 FPKM    Figure 12.12: Expression of the first 6 genes of the blischak data after the FPKM normalisation     12.6.6 TPM    Figure 12.13: Expression of the first 6 genes of the blischak data after the TPM normalisation      12.7 Exercise Perform the same analysis with read counts of the Blischak data. Use blischak/reads.rds file to load the reads SCESet object. Once you have finished please compare your results to ours (next chapter).   "],
