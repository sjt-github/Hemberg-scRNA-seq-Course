# About the course

Recent technological advances have made it possible to obtain genome-wide transcriptome data from single cells using high-throughput sequencing (scRNA-seq). Even though scRNA-seq makes it possible to address problems that are intractable with bulk RNA-seq data, analysing scRNA-seq is also more challenging.

In this course we will be surveying the existing problems as well as the available computational and statistical frameworks available for the analysis of scRNA-seq.

## Prerequisites

The course is intended for those who have basic familiarity with Unix and the R scripting language.

We will also assume that you are familiar with mapping and analysing bulk RNA-seq data as well as with the commonly available computational tools.

We recommend attending the [Introduction to RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data analysis](http://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/event/1544785) or the [Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data with Bioconductor](http://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/event/1614561) before attending this course.
