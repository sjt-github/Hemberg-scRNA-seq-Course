                 Here, we present global analyses of allelic expression across

                 abundant (12 to 24\%) monoallelic expression of autosomal
                 genes and that expression of the two alleles occurs
                 independently. The monoallelic expression appeared random and
                 dynamic because there was considerable variation among closely
                 related embryonic cells. Similar patterns of monoallelic
                 expression were observed in mature cells. Our allelic
                 expression analysis also demonstrates the de novo inactivation

                 brought new insights into complex biological phenomena. In
                 particular, genome-wide single-cell measurements such as
                 transcriptome sequencing enable the characterization of
                 cellular composition as well as functional variation in
                 homogenic cell populations. An important step in the
                 single-cell transcriptome analysis is to group cells that
                 belong to the same cell types based on gene expression
                 patterns. The corresponding computational problem is to
                 cluster a noisy high dimensional dataset with substantially
                 fewer objects (cells) than the number of variables (genes).
                 RESULTS: In this article, we describe a novel algorithm named
                 shared nearest neighbor (SNN)-Cliq that clusters single-cell
                 transcriptomes. SNN-Cliq utilizes the concept of shared
                 nearest neighbor that shows advantages in handling
                 high-dimensional data. When evaluated on a variety of
                 synthetic and real experimental datasets, SNN-Cliq
                 outperformed the state-of-the-art methods tested. More
                 importantly, the clustering results of SNN-Cliq reflect the
                 cell types or origins with high accuracy. AVAILABILITY AND

                 routinely generating transcriptomics data at the single cell
                 level. A frequent requirement of single cell expression
                 analysis is the identification of novel patterns of
                 heterogeneity across single cells that might explain complex
                 cellular states or tissue composition. To date, classical
                 statistical analysis tools have being routinely applied, but
                 there is considerable scope for the development of novel
                 statistical approaches that are better adapted to the
                 challenges of inferring cellular hierarchies. RESULTS: We have
                 developed a novel agglomerative clustering method that we call
                 pcaReduce to generate a cell state hierarchy where each
                 cluster branch is associated with a principal component of
                 variation that can be used to differentiate two cell states.
                 Using two real single cell datasets, we compared our approach
                 to other commonly used statistical techniques, such as K-means
                 and hierarchical clustering. We found that pcaReduce was able
                 to give more consistent clustering structures when compared to
                 broad and detailed cell type labels. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel
                 integration of principal components analysis and hierarchical
                 clustering establishes a connection between the representation
                 of the expression data and the number of cell types that can
                 be discovered. In doing so we found that pcaReduce performs
                 better than either technique in isolation in terms of
                 characterising putative cell states. Our methodology is
                 complimentary to other single cell clustering techniques and
                 adds to a growing palette of single cell bioinformatics tools
                 for profiling heterogeneous cell populations.",

                 pipeline to the RNA-seq analysis of single cells isolated from
                 embryonic mouse lung at E16.5. Through the pipeline analysis,

              can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of
              ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we
              describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of
              individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous
              droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell’s RNAs,
              and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA
              transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously
              while remembering transcripts’ cell of origin. We analyzed
              transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39
              transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular
              atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel
              candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological
              discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at

                 platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96
                 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a
                 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure

                 well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the

                 density and RNA input over the entire detection range and
                 excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed
                 significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure

                 These effects lead to biased quantification for short

  abstract    = "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) manifests as phenotypically and
                 functionally diverse cells, often within the same patient.
                 Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been
                 linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume
                 that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively
                 isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven
                 problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven
                 approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and
                 intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of
                 healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which
                 algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional
                 single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface
                 phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their
                 intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we
                 defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which
                 led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was
                 predictive of survival in independent cohorts. This study
                 presents new methods for large-scale analysis of single-cell
                 heterogeneity and demonstrates their utility, yielding
                 insights into AML pathophysiology.",

              samples, to account for amplification bias. We found that the
              major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven
              by genotype, but we also observed substantial variation between
              the technical replicates. We observed that the conversion of
              reads to molecules using the UMIs was impacted by both biological
              and technical variation, indicating that UMI counts are not an

                 (sc) RNA-seq libraries are based on assumptions regarding
                 their underlying enzymatic reactions. Here, we show that the
                 fairness of these assumptions varies within libraries:
                 coverage by sequencing reads along and between transcripts
                 exhibits characteristic, protocol-dependent biases. To
                 understand the mechanistic basis of this bias, we present an
                 integrated modeling framework that infers the relationship

                 characteristic coverage patterns observed for different

  abstract    = "Large-scale surveys of single-cell gene expression have the
                 potential to reveal rare cell populations and lineage
                 relationships but require efficient methods for cell capture
                 and mRNA sequencing. Although cellular barcoding strategies
                 allow parallel sequencing of single cells at ultra-low depths,
                 the limitations of shallow sequencing have not been
                 investigated directly. By capturing 301 single cells from 11
                 populations using microfluidics and analyzing single-cell
                 transcriptomes across downsampled sequencing depths, we
                 demonstrate that shallow single-cell mRNA sequencing (~50,000
                 reads per cell) is sufficient for unbiased cell-type
                 classification and biomarker identification. In the developing
                 cortex, we identify diverse cell types, including multiple
                 progenitor and neuronal subtypes, and we identify EGR1 and FOS
                 as previously unreported candidate targets of Notch signaling
                 in human but not mouse radial glia. Our strategy establishes
                 an efficient method for unbiased analysis and comparison of
                 cell populations from heterogeneous tissue by microfluidic
                 single-cell capture and low-coverage sequencing of many cells.",
